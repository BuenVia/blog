    <!--PROFITABILITY HEALTH CHECK-->

        <h3>DO YOU KNOW IF YOUR GOOD COULD BE BETTER OR YOUR BETTER COULD BE BEST?</h3>
        <p>An exercise we ran on behalf of a large work provision network, returned results that highlighted major concerns.</p>
        <p>Just 2% (4) of the 222 VDA’s invited to take part, achieved an accuracy score that exceeded 90% in the exercise.</p>
        <p>Not a single VDA achieved 100% accuracy in the benchmarked assessments,
        and with the financial results in this exercise ranging from 30% short of target to 23%
        over the target figure for accuracy (a difference of £1893 between the two extremes)
        it’s no wonder that large swathes of repairers find profit a very difficult result to achieve.</p>
        Additionally, what then could be said for the integrity of the repair?
